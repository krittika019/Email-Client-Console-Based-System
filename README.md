# Email-Client-Console-Based-System
The goal of this project is to develop a console-based email client system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles that allows users to log in, send, and receive emails categorized as either personal or work. The system should be simple, intuitive, and scalable, providing a foundation for further enhancements such as integrating with databases for email storage and user management. This system will demonstrate core OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and dynamic memory management.
